Working:
1. Make a 7z archive of the SimpleBackup script files either manually using 7z or using SimpleBackup.
   SimpleBackup.7z (It must be in 7z format).
2. Make the installer (self extracting sfx archive with gui):
   copy /b "C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.sfx" + .\SimpleBackup.7z .\SimpleBackupIntaller.exe
   

This has been automated in a bat-file:
MakeInstaller.bat
The bat-file must point to an installed 7zip installation to work.
The installation must include \7-Zip\7z.sfx to generate the self-extracting archive.
7zip installer can be found here: https://www.7-zip.org/download.html

Either it can generate a cleaned up archive using the textfile:
  
  SimpleBackupFilesWithoutRootFolder.txt
  This archive will consist of only the relevant files for deploying SimpleBackup. But when installing it the user
  must make a destination folder to store the files.
  
  or
  
  SimpleBackupFiles.txt
  This archive will consist of a rootFolder: SimpleBackup and all the files that were in that folder
  when the archive was generated.
  If SimpleBackup is in a folder with a different name the file SimpleBackupFiles.txt must use that folder name
  instead of Simplebackup to work.
