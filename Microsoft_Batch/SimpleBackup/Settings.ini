# Desciption: This is a Microsoft Batch script to automate backup and archive functionality
#             provided by standard archiving programs such as 7zip.
#             It has been developed for my personal setup and my own use case.
# Documentation: Checkout the file: Howto_Description.pdf
# Test_Disclaimer: This script has been tested on: Microsoft Windows 10 64bit home (Danish).
#                  Feel free to use this script/software at your own risk.
# File Encoding: utf-8

#All variables must be initializes or the script will not work. All varItem=VALUE must be set.
# This ini-file contains generalv settings that apply to all the different backup configurations.
# That way a change to general settings only has to be made in a single file.
