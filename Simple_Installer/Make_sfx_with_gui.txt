Working:
1. Make a 7z archive of the SimpleBackup script files either manually using 7z or using SimpleBackup.
   SimpleBackup.7z (It must be in 7z format).
2. Make the installer (self extracting sfx archive with gui):
   copy /b "C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7z.sfx" + .\SimpleBackup.7z .\SimpleBackupIntaller.exe
   

This has been automated in a bat-file:
MakeInstaller.bat
The bat-file must point to an installed 7zip installation to work.
The installation must include \7-Zip\7z.sfx to generate the self-extracting archive.
