@echo off
REM This file was added to be able to start the backup script as administrator without adding a "cd" command to the original script.
REM The "move folder" command doesn't work on my setup as a regular user and requires admin priviliges. Hence this change.
REM By adding this extra "startup batchfile" we can start the backup script as admin's without changing the original script.
REM Running the original script without "move folder options set to YES" should be working with normal priviliges.
REM Create a shortcut of this cmd file. Right-click -> then choose shortcut. Press advanced. Choose run as administrator.

set varGeneralSettingsFile=Settings.ini
CALL .\utility_functions :readBackupSettingsFile "%varGeneralSettingsFile%"

REM  Enable this to backup the latest raspberry pi 3b+ image before the general backup.
