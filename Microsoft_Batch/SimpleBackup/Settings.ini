# Version 2.3 (Github_upload date:15th of April 2021)
# Author/Developer: SÃ¸ren Madsen
# Github url: https://github.com/MrSmadsen/Development/tree/main/Microsoft_Batch/SimpleBackup
# Desciption: This is a Microsoft Batch script to automate backup and archive functionality
#             provided by standard archiving programs such as 7zip.
#             It has been developed for my personal setup and my own use case.
# Documentation: Checkout the file: Howto_Description.pdf
# Test_Disclaimer: This script has been tested on: Microsoft Windows 10 64bit home (Danish).
#                  Feel free to use this script/software at your own risk.
# File Encoding: utf-8

#All variables must be initializes or the script will not work. All varItem=VALUE must be set.
# This ini-file contains generalv settings that apply to all the different backup configurations.
# That way a change to general settings only has to be made in a single file.

###################### Length limitation settings #
# These length limitations are added to avoid or minimize code injection.
# These values MUST be read as the first values in utility_functions :readBackupSettingsFile.
# The value in varPathLength is based on a classic windows limit.
varFileNameLength=50
varFolderLength=50
varPathLength=259
